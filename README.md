# Tauri 2.0 Practice
A repo containing practice Tauri projects to better learn Tauri fundamentals, APIs, and best practices. 

Tauri is a framework to create small, fast, and secure cross-platform desktop applications. It's an alternative to the more popular Electron.js. Whereas Electron uses JavaScript for both frontend and backend logic, Tauri uses Rust for the backend while the frontend can be written using nearly any frontend technology. And unlike Electron - which bundles an entire Chromium engine with each app, introducing size, latency, and security issues - Tauri uses native webviews to render applications.
